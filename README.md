# IMDB-Lite
This is my first attempt to create an application that accesses an API.  

My goals were to familiarize myself with the XMLHTTPRequest object and its properties and methods and to familiarize myself with how HTML forms and JavaScript interact.

The application provides the user with a simple form into which they can enter the name  of a movie. The application then sends an XHR request to a movie database and returns all of the available information about that movie in a user friendly format.
